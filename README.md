# Survival-Rate-Analysis-Cancer-Outcomes
Survival Rate Analysis using Decision Trees and Prior-Fitted Networks (TabPFN) for Cancer outcomes on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) data from AACR.

The preliminary codes and results can be found in the _mskcc_tabular.ipynb_ file.

### Preliminary Results
Decision Trees give slightly better results (~5% improvement) compared to Neural Networks for the tabular cancer data while also reducing training time by over 25%. However, Prior-Fitted Networks (TabPFN) provides a way to incorporate neural networks for tabular data with faster runtimes and enhanced accuracy. 

**Note:** Detailed results from the study coming soon.
